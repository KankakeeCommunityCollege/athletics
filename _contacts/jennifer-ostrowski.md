Jennifer Ostrowski (JO) is entering her second year as an assistant volleyball coach at KCC. She comes with experience from playing college volleyball in the middle at KCC and Peru State College in Nebraska.

JO is a full-time kindergarten teacher at Chebanse Elementary School and absolutely loves it\! She canâ€™t wait to bring her love for the game to the Cavaliers team again this year.

JO lives in Gilman with her boyfriend and their three awesome dogs, which keep them busy.
