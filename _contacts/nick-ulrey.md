Coach Ulrey is entering his seventh season as a Cavaliers assistant. He primarily works with hitters and catchers, and serves as the third base coach.

Since joining KCC in 2018, Coach Ulrey has seen 27 hitters move on to four-year schools (seven to NCAA Division I, 11 to NCAA Division II, two to NCAA Division III and seven to NAIA). Since 2018, the Cavaliers offense has produced two NJCAA All-Americans, 11 NJCAA All-Region players, one Region IV Player of the Year, and one NJCAA Player of the Week.

Ulrey’s collegiate career started at KCC in 2013, where he started both years behind the plate. At KCC, he earned All-Region honors and is in the top 20 in five offensive categories, and top 25 in two others. Ulrey transferred to UMSL, where he was a two-time All-Conference selection and led the Great Lakes Valley Conference both years in runners caught stealing. Ulrey collected 231 hits and posted a career .334 batting average. In 2020, UMSL selected Ulrey to the All-Decade Team.
