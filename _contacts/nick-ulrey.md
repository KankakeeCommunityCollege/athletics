Coach Ulrey is entering his sixth season as an assistant at KCC. For the Cavaliers, Ulrey works primarily with the hitters and catchers.

In two seasons, the Cavaliers offense produced one NJCAA All-American, 11 NJCAA All-Region players, and 13 players with Top 10 within NJCAA offensive stats. The Cavaliers have averaged 8.6 runs and a .326 batting average since Ulrey came on board.&nbsp;
