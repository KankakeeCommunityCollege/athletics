Coach Ulrey has been a Cavaliers assistant since 2018. He primarily works with hitters and catchers and serves as the third base coach.

Prior to KCC, Ulrey was an assistant coach at NCAA Division II University of Missouri–St. Louis (UMSL). Among his five summers coaching baseball, one was for the College Summer League at Grand Park in Westfield, Indiana.

Coach Ulrey has helped 32 Cavaliers hitters move on to four-year schools (seven to NCAA Division I, 16 to NCAA Division II, two to NCAA Division III, and seven to NAIA). Five of those NCAA Division II players were on last year’s team. Since 2018, the Cavaliers offense has produced two NJCAA All-Americans, 11 NJCAA All-Region players, one Region 4 Player of the Year, and one NJCAA Player of the Week. In 2025, KCC had two All-Region selections—Amarion Paxton and Dylan Coty, who stole 42 bases to break the program’s single-season record.

A native of New Palestine, Indiana, Ulrey’s collegiate career began at KCC in 2013. He was the starting catcher both years. Ulrey earned All-Region honors and ranks in the program’s top 20 in five offensive categories, and top 25 in two others. Ulrey transferred to UMSL, where he was a two-time All-Conference selection and led the Great Lakes Valley Conference in runners caught stealing both seasons. He collected 231 hits and posted a .334 career batting average. In 2020, UMSL selected Ulrey to its All-Decade Team.

Coach Ulrey resides in Bourbonnais and is the proud father of Vincent. He holds a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from UMSL.
