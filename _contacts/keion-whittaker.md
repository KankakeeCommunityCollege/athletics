New to the coaching staff for 2024-25, Keion Whittaker is ready to make an impact. His love for the game led him to coaching, and Whittaker has come to appreciate the grind of the sport.

Whittaker is eager for the season. &ldquo;I consider myself a basketball junkie and a student of the game, so I am excited for the opportunity Coach Meister gave me and cannot wait to learn from her and make my mark,&rdquo; Whittaker said.

As a scouting expert, he will play a vital role preparing for each contest.

Whittaker also works at KCC in the Information Technology Services department.
