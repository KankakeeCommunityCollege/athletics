Keion Whittaker began as an assistant coach for the Cavaliers in the 2024-25 season, bringing passion, energy, and a relentless work ethic to the coaching staff. A self-described “basketball junkie” and true student of the game, Whittaker thrives on the preparation and grind that coaching demands.

A proud Kankakee native and graduate of Kankakee High School, Whittaker is deeply connected to the local community. In addition to his coaching duties, he also serves in KCC’s Information Technology Services and Physical Plant departments.

“I’m grateful for the opportunity Coach Meister has given me,” said Whittaker. “I love this game, and I’m excited to keep learning and making my mark.”
