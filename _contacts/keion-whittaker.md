New to the coaching staff in 2024, Keion Whittaker comes ready to make an impact. His love for the game led him to coaching and has come to appreciate the grind of the sport. As a scouting expert, he will play a vital role in the preparations of each contest. He is a graduate of Kankakee High School and remained close to home by attending KCC. He currently works at KCC in the Technology department and now for the Women’s Basketball program. Keion is eager for the season to start and gave more insight by stating “I consider myself a basketball junkie and a student of the game so I am excited for the opportunity Coach Meister gave me and cannot wait to learn from her and make my mark.” He is a welcomed new face and will help round out the coaching&nbsp;staff.
