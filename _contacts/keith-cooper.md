Cooper’s involvement as a coach has taken him to coaching many tournaments at Illinois State University in Normal; Central Michigan University in Mt. Pleasant; and three State Fast Pitch Softball Tournaments in National Softball Association of&nbsp;Illinois.

Prior to becoming the head coach for Lady Cavs softball, he assisted with the KCC Women’s Basketball team as official scorekeeper for home games and often traveled with the&nbsp;team.
