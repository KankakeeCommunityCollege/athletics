A former KCC player, Jenny Coronelli is returning for her third year as assistant coach alongside Coach Meister.

Coronelli attributes much of her personal success to the valuable lessons she learned at KCC.
&ldquo;KCC taught me that hard work was the only way to achieve success,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was lucky enough to achieve success on the court as we played for two National Championships, but the true success came from the education I received, the friendships I made, and the scholarship I earned following my two years here.&rdquo;

After graduating from KCC in 2008, Coronelli received a full scholarship to play basketball at Kentucky Wesleyan University (NCAA Division II) in Owensboro. She earned a bachelor's degree in sports management from Kentucky Wesleyan, and a master’s degree in education from Olivet Nazarene University. She is currently working on a doctorate in curriculum and instruction through Aurora University in Illinois, with an estimated graduation date of December 2025. Coronelli teaches physical education at Reed-Custer Middle school, where she also coaches eighth grade girl’s basketball and track.

She lives in Limestone with her dog, Bootsie. She is looking forward to a season of growth and competing.
