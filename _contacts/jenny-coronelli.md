Jenny Coronelli returns for her third consecutive year as assistant coach. Once a KCC player herself, she found a passion for coaching early on in her career which has carried her through multiple levels of coaching including Middle School, High school, and now KCC. Jenny speaks highly of KCC and attributes much of her personal success to the valuable lessons she learned while attending, “KCC taught me that hard work was the only way to achieve success. I was lucky enough to achieve success on the court as we played for two National Championships but the true success came from the education I received, the friendships I made, and the scholarship I earned following my two years here.” Jenny received a full ride scholarship to play basketball at Kentucky Wesleyan, a NCAA Division II school located in Owensboro, Kentucky where she received a Bachelor's Degree in Sports Management. She continued her academic career by completing her Master’s Degree in Education followed by a Doctoral Degree in Curriculum and Instruction through Aurora University in Aurora, IL with an estimated graduation date of December 2025.She currently teaches Middle School Physical Education at Reed-Custer Middle school where she also coaches 8th grade girls basketball as well as middle school track.

Coach Coronelli lives in Limestone, IL with her dog Bootsie and is looking forward to a season of growth and competing.
