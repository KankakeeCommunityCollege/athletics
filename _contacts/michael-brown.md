Prior to Maryville, Brown served two seasons as the head coach at Richard J. Daley College in Chicago. Despite being hired in late October 2015 for his rookie campaign, Brown increased Daley’s win total by seven victories over the previous year.&nbsp; He followed that up with a 15-win season, the most wins at the school since 2011-12.

Before taking over the Daley program, Brown was an assistant coach at NCAA Division II Saint Joseph's College in Rensselaer, Ind. In his one-year stay with the Pumas, the team improved its win total from the previous season and had an All-Conference selection.

Brown served two years as an assistant coach at Kankakee (Ill.) Community College and helped the Cavaliers make back-to-back trips to the Region IV Tournament championship game. He was part of the 2013-14 the team that posted a 25-5 record and closed out the season ranked 25th in the final NJCAA Division I poll. Prior to Kankakee, Brown was an assistant coach at Rock Valley (Ill.) College, where the team went 20-11 in 2011-12 to notch its first winning season in over a decade. Over his career, Brown has coached three NJCAA All-Americans, one NJCAA Academic All-American and eight All-Region players.

Brown also found success as an assistant high school coach at his alma mater De La Salle Institute, in Chicago.&nbsp; De La Salle won the 2009 regional title and advanced to the sectional semifinals before finishing 21-5. The Meteors were also ranked as high as No. 2 in the state of Illinois Class 4A. During his playing career at De La Salle, Brown garnered All-Catholic League honors and was selected to the Daily Southtown All-Area honorable mention team.&nbsp;

After concluding his graduating from De La Salle, Brown attended Saint Xavier University in Chicago.&nbsp; He played a key role in SXU’s 30-7 record in 2004-05 that also included the team earning the No. 14 ranking in the NAIA’s final poll and reaching the Elite Eight of the NAIA Division I tournament.

Brown, who is also KCC’s enrollment services recruiter, received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Saint Xavier University and a master’s degree in sports leadership from Concordia University Chicago.
