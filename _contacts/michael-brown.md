For 2022-23, Mike Brown enters his second season as the head coach of the KCC men’s basketball program. The 2021-22 Cavs finished the season as a NJCAA All-Academic team with a 3.05 team GPA, earned 19 victories, and made it to the Region IV championship game.

Over his career, Brown has also coached three NJCAA All-Americans, three NJCAA Academic All-Americans and 10 All-Region players.

Before KCC, Brown served as an assistant coach at Purdue University Northwest from 2018-20, helping the Pride to its most successful season since joining NCAA Div. II. Before Purdue, Brown was assistant coach at Maryville University in St. Louis for a season. He helped the Saints to a 20-8 record, 11 more wins than the previous season. The Saints also were Great Lakes Valley Conference Central Division regular season champs and advanced to the GLVC conference tournament.

Brown also served two seasons as head coach at Richard J. Daley College in Chicago. Despite being hired in late October 2015, he increased Daley’s win total by seven over the previous year. In his next season (2016-17), the team had 15 wins, the most since 2011-12.

Before Daley, Brown was an assistant at NCAA Div. II Saint Joseph’s College in Rensselaer, Indiana. That year, the Pumas earned more wins than the previous season and had an All-Conference selection.

Brown also served as an assistant coach at Governors State University and for two years as an assistant coach at KCC. During that tenure with the Cavaliers, the team secured back-to-back trips to the Region IV Tournament championship game. The 2013-14 team posted a 25-5 record and was ranked 25th in the final NJCAA Div. I poll. Prior to KCC, Brown was an assistant coach at Rock Valley College in 2011-12, where the team went 20-11, notching its first winning season in over a decade.

Brown also found success as an assistant high school coach in 2008-09 at his alma mater, De La Salle Institute, in Chicago. De La Salle won the regional title and the Meteors were ranked as high as No. 2 in Illinois Class 4A. The team advanced to the sectional semifinals before finishing 21-5. While Brown was a player, he garnered All-Catholic League honors and was on the Daily Southtown All-Area honorable mention team.

Brown attended Saint Xavier University in Chicago. He played a key role in SXU’s 30-7 record (2004-05) on a squad that was ranked No. 14 in the NAIA’s final poll and reached the Elite Eight in the NAIA Div. I tournament.

At KCC, Brown is also the Coordinator of Enrollment Services. He has a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Saint Xavier University and a master’s degree in sports leadership from Concordia University in Chicago.
