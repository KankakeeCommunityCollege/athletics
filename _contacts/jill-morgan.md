**Jill Morgan - Head Volleyball Coach, Kankakee Community College**

Jill Morgan brings a wealth of experience, passion, and success to the KCC volleyball program. With over 15 years of coaching across multiple sports, Jill has established herself as a dynamic leader committed to athlete development and competitive excellence. Her volleyball journey is marked by impactful contributions at various levels, from youth leagues to high school varsity, and now collegiate coaching.

Jill made an immediate impact upon stepping in as KCC’s interim head volleyball coach, guiding the team to an impressive 8-2 record and a Region 4 semifinal appearance. Under her leadership, the Cavaliers finished the season with a stellar 21-10 record, showcasing her ability to foster teamwork, discipline, and resilience in her athletes. Her coaching philosophy emphasizes technical skill development, mental toughness, and a love for the game—values that resonate with her players and create a winning culture both on and off the court.

Before joining KCC, Jill founded and coached the Men’s varsity volleyball program at Bishop McNamara High School, where she successfully built a competitive team over three seasons. This role honed her ability to prepare young athletes for higher levels of competition. In addition, Jill has extensive experience coaching youth sports, including volleyball, soccer, and travel softball. Her involvement in local sports extends beyond coaching, as she has served as Treasurer of the BBYSL Youth Softball League and President of the Dynamo Soccer League.

Beyond the court, Jill excels professionally as the Office Manager and Sales Leader at The Matt Waite State Farm Agency. A resident of Bourbonnais, Jill lives with her partner Luke and their five children: Logan and Carter, both students at KCC (Carter also serves as the starting goalkeeper for the Cavaliers’ men’s soccer team), and Kaylie, Abigail, and Evelyn.

Jill is excited to bring her energy, expertise, and dedication to KCC volleyball. Her mission is to elevate the program by developing technically skilled, confident athletes who embody sportsmanship and a relentless work ethic. She is committed to building a cohesive, competitive team that strives for excellence in every aspect of the game.

“I am truly blessed to have this opportunity at KCC. My goal is to create a program that not only competes at the highest level but also helps players grow as individuals and teammates. Together, we will work hard, support one another, and build a program the entire KCC community can be proud of.”
