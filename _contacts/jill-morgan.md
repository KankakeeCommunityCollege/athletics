**Jill Morgan - Head Volleyball Coach, Kankakee Community College**

With over 15 years coaching multiple sports, Jill Morgan is a leader committed to athlete development and competitive excellence.

In 2024, Morgan made an impact as KCC’s interim head volleyball coach, guiding the team to win eight of the final 10 games and compete in the Region 4 semifinals. The Cavaliers finished the season with a 21-10 record.

With a coaching philosophy that emphasizes mental toughness and love for the game—Morgan brings energy, expertise, and dedication to KCC volleyball. Her mission is to elevate the program by developing a winning culture through technically skilled, confident athletes who embody sportsmanship and a relentless work ethic. She is committed to building a cohesive, competitive team that strives for excellence in every aspect of the game and in life off of the court.

Before joining KCC, Morgan was founder and coach of varsity boys volleyball at Bishop McNamara High School in Kankakee for three seasons. In addition, Morgan has coached youth in volleyball, soccer and travel softball. She has served as treasurer of the Bradley-Bourbonnais Youth Softball League and as president of the Dynamo Soccer League.

Professionally, Morgan is the office manager and sales leader at the Matt Waite State Farm Agency. A resident of Bourbonnais, Morgan lives with her partner, Luke, and their five children: Logan, Carter, Kaylie, Abigail and Evelyn. Logan and Carter are KCC students, and Carter is the starting goalkeeper for the Cavaliers men’s soccer team (2024).

“I am truly blessed to have this opportunity at KCC,” Morgan said. “My goal is to create a program that not only competes at the highest level, but also helps players grow as individuals and teammates. Together, we will work hard, support one another, and build a program the entire KCC community can be proud of.”
