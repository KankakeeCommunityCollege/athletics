The nationally recognized KCC women’s basketball program has a new head coach at the helm.&nbsp;

After serving seven years as the assistant for KCC, Casey Hadley Meister has taken over as the head women’s basketball coach. Meister was assistant to Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Famer Donnie Denson. Over those years, the Cavaliers earned an overall record of 147-59 (.714), four Region 4 Championship titles, and made four national tournament appearances, including finishes of 4th and 7th place.

Before coaching at KCC, Meister spent six years as a high school teacher and coach at Tri-Point High School (2008-14).&nbsp;

A 2006 graduate of KCC, Meister was a two-time All-Region 4 honoree and was MVP of the All-Region 4 Tournament Team in 2006. She earned NJCAA All-American honors in 2005 and 2006, and played in the 2006 national tournament. Meister is in the elite “1,000 Point Club,” finishing with 1,014 points at KCC. In 2019, Coach Meister was inducted into the NJCAA Region IV Hall of Fame.

After KCC, Meister continued her basketball career with a full scholarship to Chicago State University (NCAA Div. I). Her competitive mentality led her to Olivet Nazarene University (NAIA Div. I) to finish her senior year on scholarship. In her senior season (2007-08), ONU won the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference Tournament, led the country in team scoring average, was nationally ranked, and made an NAIA National Tournament appearance.&nbsp;

A native of Diamond, Meister played high school basketball at Reed-Custer High School, earning IHSA All-State honors in 2003 and 2004.&nbsp;

Meister resides in Ashkum with her husband, Todd, and their three children, Hadley, Harper and Hudson.&nbsp;

Coach Meister is excited and eager to start as the head women’s basketball coach and assistant athletic director. Both roles give her the ability to work directly with student athletes and build a foundation of trust, dedication, and success in the place she calls home.
