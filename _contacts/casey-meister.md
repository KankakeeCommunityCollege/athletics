Casey Meister is beginning her fourth season at the helm for the Lady Cavaliers.

Prior to becoming head coach, Meister served seven years as the assistant for KCC, where the Cavaliers earned an overall record of 147-59 (.714). Postseason accomplishments included four Region 4 Championship titles, four national tournament appearances including a 4th and 7th place finish.

She has coached three All-Americans, 12 Academic All-Americans, and helped place 24 athletes at the next level.

Before coaching at KCC, Meister spent six years as a teacher and varsity coach at Tri-Point High School (2008-14). A 2006 graduate of KCC, Meister was a two-time All-Region 4 honoree and MVP of the All-Region 4 Tournament Team in 2006. She earned NJCAA All-American honors in 2005 and 2006, and played in the 2006 national tournament. Meister is in the elite &ldquo;1,000 Point Club,&rdquo; finishing with 1,014 points at KCC. In 2019, Coach Meister was inducted into the NJCAA Region IV Hall of Fame.

After KCC, Meister continued playing basketball with a full scholarship to Chicago State University (NCAA Div. I). Her competitive mentality led her to Olivet Nazarene University (NAIA Div. I) to finish her senior year on scholarship. During that season (2007-08), ONU won the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference Tournament, led the country in team scoring average, was nationally ranked, and made an NAIA National Tournament appearance.

A native of Diamond, Meister earned IHSA All-State honors in 2003 and 2004 at Reed-Custer High School. She resides in Ashkum with her husband, Todd, and their three children, Hadley, Harper and Hudson.

Coach Meister also serves as KCC’s assistant athletic director. Both roles give her the ability to work directly with student athletes and build a foundation of trust, dedication, and success in the place she calls home.
