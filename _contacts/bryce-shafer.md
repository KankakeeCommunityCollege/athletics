Coach Shafer brings extensive experience and a strong commitment to player development to his role as head coach at KCC. After eight successful years as the pitching coach, Coach Shafer is prepared to lead the team to new heights.

Player development lies at the core of Shafer's coaching philosophy, emphasizing the growth of athletes both on and off the field.

During Shafer's tenure, 35 pitchers have advanced to four-year schools, with many earning scholarships at NCAA Division I institutions. Two pitchers, Waylon Richardson (Philadelphia Phillies) and Dylan Dodd (Atlanta Braves), were drafted by Major League Baseball. Dodd is currently on the Braves roster. Notably, Coach Shafer was also the Cavaliers' pitching coach when the team won the National Championship (2017). The top five strikeout seasons in KCC's history happened under Shafer's guidance, and seven pitchers earned All-Region honors during his tenure.

Before coaching, Shafer had a successful playing career at Valparaiso University, where he led the team in wins for three consecutive seasons. In 2010, he was recognized as the Horizon League Pitcher of the Year and earned First Team All-Conference honors. With 121 strikeouts in 105 innings pitched, Shafer ranks among the top 10 strikeout leaders in Valpo history, despite playing only three seasons.

Shafer was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 49th round. During three seasons in the minor leagues, Shafer pitched 111 innings, posted a 2.99 ERA and struck out 110. Shafer played two additional seasons in independent baseball with the Frontier Greys and River City Rascals.

In 2015, Shafer earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Fort Hays State University, further enriching his understanding of the mental aspects of the game. Today, he resides in Manteno with his wife, Jill, and their sons, Carver and Callum.

Coach Shafer is set to propel KCC's baseball program to new heights. With a steadfast focus on player development and a proven track record of success, Shafer is committed to guiding the team toward new achievements while fostering a culture of growth, achievement, and excellence both on and off the field.
