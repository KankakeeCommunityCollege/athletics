Richardson was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies (2018) and Dodd was selected 96th overall by the Atlanta Braves in the 3rd round of the 2021 MLB draft. In 2022, the Cavaliers pitching staff broke the KCC strikeout record with 526 strikeouts on the season.

Prior to KCC, Coach Shafer attended Valparaiso University from 2007-10. He was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the 2010 Major League Baseball Amateur Draft. In 2010 at Valparaiso, Shafer tallied 121 strikeouts, second-most in Crusader history and third m​ost in Horizon League history, earning him Horizon League Pitcher of the Year and First Team All-Conference honors.

Shafer pitched in the Cubs organization from 2010 to 2012 (2.99 ERA, 110 strikeouts, 111.1 innings). In 2013 Shafer pitched for the Frontier Greys and in 2014, for the River City Rascals, both in the Frontier League of Independent Baseball.
