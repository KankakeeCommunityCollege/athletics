Coach Shafer brings extensive experience and a strong commitment to player development to the Cavaliers. Since becoming head coach, he has guided the Cavaliers to national prominence, compiling an 84-33-1 record in two seasons. His teams have consistently competed at the highest level of NJCAA Division II baseball, including a Top 10 national ranking in 2025 and 46 wins—one of the best seasons in program&nbsp;history.

During his tenure as both an assistant and head coach, 47 Cavaliers pitchers have advanced to four-year schools, including many going to NCAA Div. I. Two pitchers were MLB draft selections— Waylon Richardson (40th round, Philadelphia Phillies) and Dylan Dodd (3rd round, Atlanta Braves). Dodd is currently on the Braves' roster. Most recently Peyton Niksch signed with the Milwaukee Brewers in July 2025. Niksch was Region 4 Player of the Year and a First-Team All-American.

Since Shafer started coaching KCC’s pitchers, the Cavs have had seven of the top 10 strikeout seasons in program history, and nine pitchers have earned All-Region honors. In 2025, the Cavs ranked second nationally in team ERA and fifth in strikeouts, led by Niksch (1.36 ERA) and Cole Martz (1.75 ERA). Niksch and Matz both ranked in the top five nationally. Shafer was KCC’s pitching coach during the 2017 NJCAA National Championship&nbsp;season.

Shafer had a standout collegiate career at Valparaiso University, leading the team in wins for three straight seasons. In 2010, he was Horizon League Pitcher of the Year and earned First Team All-Conference honors. Shafer is among the program’s all-time leaders with 121 strikeouts in 105&nbsp;innings.

The Chicago Cubs selected Shafer in the 49th round of the MLB Draft in 2010. During three seasons in affiliated ball, Shafer completed 111 innings with a 2.99 ERA and 110 strikeouts. He also played two seasons with the Frontier Greys and River City Rascals. Shafer continues to compete with the Beecher Muskies in the Chicago Suburban Baseball League. In June 2024, Shafer threw a perfect game for the Muskies. He has been CSBL Pitcher of the Year in 2020, 2022, 2023 and&nbsp;2024.

Shafer earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Fort Hays State University in 2015, further deepening his understanding of the mental side of performance. He lives in Manteno with his wife, Jill, and their sons, Carver and&nbsp;Callum.

With a steadfast focus on pitching development and a proven track record of success, Shafer remains committed to elevating KCC baseball through a culture rooted in growth, accountability, and competitive&nbsp;excellence.
