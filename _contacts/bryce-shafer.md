Coach Shafer brings extensive experience and a relentless commitment to player development to the Cavaliers. Since becoming head coach in 2024, he has guided KCC to national prominence, compiling an 84-33-1 record. In 2025, the Cavs finished with a 46-10 record and No. 8 rank in the NJCAA national poll.

Shafer’s teams have been built around elite pitching. Last season’s staff backed it up—No. 2 nationally in team ERA, No. 5 in strikeouts, and No. 12 in strikeouts per nine innings. With Peyton Niksch (1.36 ERA, No. 3 nationally) and Cole Martz (1.75 ERA, No. 5 nationally) anchoring the rotation, KCC’s pitching staff had some of the stats in the country. Niksch earned honors as a First Team All-American and Region 4 Player of the Year before signing with the Milwaukee Brewers.

During Shafer’s time as both an assistant and head coach, 47 Cavaliers pitchers have advanced to NCAA Division I programs and other four-year schools. Two pitchers were MLB draft selections—Waylon Richardson (40th round, Philadelphia Phillies) and Dylan Dodd (3rd round, Atlanta Braves). Eight position players moved on to four-year schools following last season (six NCAA Division II and two NAIA).

Since Shafer began coaching KCC’s pitchers, the Cavs have produced eight of the top 10 strikeout seasons in program history, and nine pitchers have earned All-Region honors. Shafer was also KCC’s pitching coach during the program’s 2017 NJCAA National Championship season.

Shafer had a standout collegiate career at Valparaiso University, leading the team in wins for three straight seasons. In 2010, he was named Horizon League Pitcher of the Year and earned First Team All-Conference honors. The Chicago Cubs selected Shafer in the 49th round of the 2010 MLB Draft. During three seasons in affiliated baseball, he threw 111 innings with a 2.99 ERA and 110 strikeouts and later played two seasons in the Frontier League.

Shafer continues to compete with the Beecher Muskies in the Chicago Suburban Baseball League. In June 2024, he threw a perfect game for the Muskies and has earned CSBL Pitcher of the Year honors in 2020, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. In July 2025, the Muskies won the NABF World Series and Shafer was named Co-MVP.

Shafer has a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Fort Hays State University (2105), deepening his understanding of the mental side of performance. He lives in Manteno with his wife, Jill, and their sons, Carver and Callum.

With a steadfast focus on pitching development and a proven track record of results, Shafer remains committed to elevating KCC baseball through a culture rooted in growth, accountability, and competitive excellence.
