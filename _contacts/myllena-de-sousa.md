A native of San Pablo, Brazil, De Sousa came to the U.S. on a basketball scholarship to play at Parkview Christian High School in Lincoln, Nebraska. She played for the Cavaliers from 2022 to 2024 under Coach Meister, earning NJCAA Academic All-American honors (2023). She graduated from KCC in 2024.
