He has continued to build upon the program's history of success, and the Cavaliers have won the Region IV championship 22 times in the last 29 years.

In 2019, Coach Denson was inducted into the Region IV Hall of Fame in the category of Women's Basketball Coach and Administrator. The same year, he was also inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame.

Denson came to KCC as a Fitness Center specialist and athletic trainer in 1992, and is currently the assistant athletic director.
