A former KCC player, De'Jah Weathersby is in her first season as women's basketball assistant coach. Weathersby has experience as a community college, and NAIA Div. I athlete, she provides guidance to the student-athletes on reaching the next level, plus valuable input and game-planning skills.

Weathersby is a 2017 graduate of Rich South High School. As a high school sophomore, the Stars made it to the Illinois Class 3A Elite 8. As a senior—while starting alongside two athletes who would move on to the NCAA Div. I Big East—Weathersby averaged 11 points per game and was a “knockdown shooter,” with a team-leading 40 3-pointers.

At KCC she played for Hall of Fame Coach Donnie Denson and the Lady Cavaliers from 2017-19. Weathersby was a standout performer, averaging 12 points, 2 assists, and 4 rebounds per game. She also contributed to a Region IV Championship Title and National Tournament appearance in 2018. During her sophomore year at KCC, she was top 3 in every major statistical category and second in scoring.&nbsp;

Weathersby continued her basketball career with a scholarship to Lincoln College in central Illinois. During her first season at Lincoln, she battled leg injuries and was still a major contributor to a talented team that finished with a 20-9 record and narrowly missed a national tournament bid. Although doctors said her basketball career was possibly over, Weathersby overcame a major stress fracture in her leg to start 11 of 15 games her senior season, highlighted by a 14-point performance against Holy Cross.

In 2021 Weathersby graduated cum laude with a 3.5 GPA and a bachelor’ degree in sport management.

Weathersby resides in Matteson.
