Bailey White is entering her second season as the head coach of the KCC women’s volleyball program. Since White took over the program, the Lady Cavs went from five wins in 2022 to 13 last season, ending with a tough 3-0 loss during the Region IV quarterfinals. The 2023-24 Lady Cavs were an NJCAA All-Academic team with a 3.09 GPA and four Academic All-Americans. 

Before KCC, White was a graduate assistant at Olivet Nazarene University for men’s and women’s volleyball. During the year she was at Olivet, the team had two defensive players of the week in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference and two Second Team All-Conference athletes. In that time, the men’s program was 11-2 in the conference, 18-8 overall, and was ranked No. 23 in the NAIA’s final poll.

White is a graduate of Resurrection College Prep High School in Chicago, earning a regional title in 2016-2017. She was in the top 15 for digs and serving aces in the Girls Catholic Athletic Conference. White played one year at Oral Roberts University (NCAA Division I) and earned a bachelor’s degree in public relations and advertising.

At KCC, White serves as Athletic Retention Success Advisor and is excited to help athletes excel in the classroom. She has a passion for the game and is thrilled to be at KCC, coaching at the collegiate level like her father. White lives in Bourbonnais, with her cat Bullseye. In her free time, she likes to cook with her boyfriend, Josh.
