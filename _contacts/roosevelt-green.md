Roosevelt Green is in his first season as an assistant coach for KCC. He joins the Cavaliers after two seasons as an assistant coach at Saint Xavier University in Chicago. As the lead recruiter, Green helped coach multiple players to all-conference recognition while also achieving a 20-win season. &nbsp;

Prior to Saint Xavier, Green was an assistant coach at Moraine Valley Community College for four seasons. During that time, Moraine Valley achieved multiple 20-win seasons along with a conference championship.

“Roosevelt is a great addition to our program,” said KCC Head Coach Michael Brown. “With his combination of playing and coaching experience, he will be able to help us in all areas of the program.”

Coach Green played basketball at Saint Xavier University, where he was a three-time all-conference honoree and an NAIA All-American (2012-13). He is also the Cougars’ all-time assists leader. Roosevelt received a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Saint Xavier University.
