2026 is Ryan Eiermann’s first season on the KCC coaching staff. Eiermann works primarily with the pitching staff, bringing firsthand experience as an elite strike-thrower and summer-league coach.

As a Cavalier during the 2022 season, Eiermann was one of the most dominant arms in program history and earned First Team All-Region honors. He is the Cavaliers single-season strikeout record holder, posting 113 strikeouts in 12 appearances (12 starts) in 2022. Also in 2022, he issued just 13 walks, held opponents to a .192 batting average, recorded a 2.34 ERA, an 8-2 record, three complete games and one shutout across 77.0 innings.

Eiermann continued his career at NAIA powerhouse Southeastern University, competing at a high level and further sharpening his approach to pitching and preparation. He launched his coaching career in the Prospect League with the Illinois Valley Pistol Shrimp, and will return as their pitching coach in the summer of 2026.

With his blend of pitching experience and a rising coaching profile, Eiermann adds instant energy and credibility to the Cavaliers. He plays a key role in maintaining the staff’s focus on execution, competitiveness, and elite standards.
