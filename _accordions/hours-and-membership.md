#### First-time registration
{: .typography__h4 }

Students enrolling in the Personal Fitness course for the first time must schedule an assessment and orientation session. Contact the Fitness Center at 802-8610 to make an appointment.

Orientations usually begin about a week before the semester begins and must be complete to begin using the Fitness Center. To be considered enrolled in the course, students must begin Fitness Center sessions within the first week of the semester start date.

To re-enroll, complete the [re-enrollment form](/uploads/fitnesscenter-re-enroll.pdf){: target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' } (fill in online or print a copy), print and bring it with you to register. Forms are also available in the Fitness Center and Student Affairs Division.

After you have registered, schedule your 60-minute orientation by phoning 815-802-8610 or stopping by the Fitness Center. Times may vary.

A member of the Fitness Center staff will take you through a fitness assessment which includes: girth, height, weight, resting heart rate and body fat composition.

You will receive a tour of the Fitness Center and locker rooms along with an explanation of our 21 Life Fitness cable-assisted lifting machines.

Please allow 60 minutes for the assessment and orientation. The orientation counts toward your Fitness Center grade.
