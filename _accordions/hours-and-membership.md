A member of the Fitness Center staff will take you through a fitness assessment which includes: girth, height, weight, resting heart rate and body fat composition.

You will receive a tour of the Fitness Center and locker rooms along with an explanation of our 21 Life Fitness cable-assisted lifting machines.

Please allow 60 minutes for the assessment and orientation. The orientation counts toward your Fitness Center grade.
