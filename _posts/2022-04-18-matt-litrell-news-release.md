“A familiar announcement every game for two years during 2016-2017 spring seasons, batting lead-off for the Cavaliers 2nd baseman \#13 Matt Littrell.” Roy Cordes announces.

Matt was a 2-year starter for Kankakee Community College Baseball after missing the previous season recovering from a major knee injury.

He was a key member of the 2017 National Championship team as our starting 2B and lead off hitter. Matt was named the MVP of the National Tournament and still holds the record for 15 RBIs in the tournament. He was also named the Best Defensive Player of the National Tournament. Matt was 1st Team All Region IV and Academic All-American in 2017. He transferred to Ashland University and was an All0 Conference player 2018 and 2019. He received his bachelor’s degree from Ashland University in 2019.

Coach Post says, “You will not find a better teammate or person than Matt Littrell. He had a tremendous career at KCC that culminated in a National Championship. He took his play to the next level at the World Series both offensively and defensively.”

Matt joins KCC Baseball Alumni Bryce Redeker and Casey Fletcher, as well as Coach Todd Post as members of the Region IV Hall of Fame.
