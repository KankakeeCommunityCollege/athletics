The Kankakee Community College men’s soccer team ended their season Saturday afternoon with a dominant 4-1 victory over Bryant and Stratton College.&nbsp;

The KCC Cavaliers had five attempts on goal within the first 30 minutes, coming from Mark Griffith, Nathaniel Brown, Matt Guiney, and Marc Robertson. Following a missed shot by the Bobcats, the loose ball was knocked into the goal by Griffith to put the Cavaliers ahead 1-0.

After a breakaway shot by Brown was deflected and the Bobcats took control of the play, Adrian Duncan stepped up defensively, and passed to Brown, who recorded an assist when Jesus Guzman scored for the Cavs.&nbsp;

With one minute remaining in the first half, the Bobcats pushed through KCC’s defense to score their only goal of the match, narrowing the Cavaliers’ lead to 2-1.

Robertson played a key part in the Cavaliers’ defensive in the second half by taking the ball away from the Bobcats every time they neared the goal. Robertson also scored on a pass from Malachai Daniel to extend KCC’s lead to 3-1.

Daniel also scored on a pass from Chris Garcia late in the match to give the Cavaliers their last point and a 4-1 victory.

The Cavaliers ended the season with a record of 6-9.
