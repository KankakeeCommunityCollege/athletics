Following the NJCAA's announcement this week that fall and winter sports will be held, but on a [delayed schedule](https://d2o2figo6ddd0g.cloudfront.net/h/u/dk9lnct08xxptv/NJCAA_Updated_Plan_of_Action.pdf){: target="_blank"}, KCC athletics will spend the fall preparing for next year's competitions.

The seasons for indoor sports, volleyball, men’s and women’s basketball, will begin in January 2021. Volleyball is traditionally a fall sport, and basketball seasons usually begin in November. Fall outdoor seasons for men’s and women’s soccer will be delayed until April 2021.

Schedules for individual teams will be posted to athletics.kcc.edu as soon as they are available. Additional information on the NJCAA Plan of Action are on [KCC's news site](https://news.kcc.edu/2020/07/14/kcc-sports-will-restart-in-2021.html) and at [njcaa.org](https://www.njcaa.org/general/2019-20/releases/20200713l9o7t8){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;
