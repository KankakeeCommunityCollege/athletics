The Kankakee Community College Cavaliers men's soccer team took on the Northeast Community College Hawks Saturday, Aug. 9. The Hawks, ranked seventh in the NJCAA Div. II pre-season poll, took control of the game early. After several saves by KCC goalkeeper Tariq Singh, the Hawks capitalized on an open field and scored first.

The Hawks played fast, and scored again at the end of the first half.

In the second half, the Cavaliers increased the pressure when Mark Griffith, a KCC sophomore, made a decisive drive to the net, passing to another sophomore, Marc Robertson, who shot and nearly scored. Northeast was able to turn the game around and extended their lead to 3-0.

The Cavaliers’ defense continued to improve as the game progressed, and they topped every other drive by the Hawks.

KCC’s offense in the second half was more aggressive, led by sophomore Adrian Duncan, who made shots from the ground and the air. In the last moments of the game, KCC had one more opportunity following a failed Northeast penalty kick. On that Hail Mary shot, Kankakee High School grad Noah Lacy just missed the net. The game ended with Northeast earning the win, 3-0.

The Cavaliers record is 2-3 going into their match against Madison College in Madison, Wisconsin, on Tuesday.
