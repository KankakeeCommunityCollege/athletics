The Cavaliers softball program look to make their mark on the 2019 season with two sophomores and 13 freshmen. The team features a wide variety of pitching, hitting, and defense, and expects to be a strong contender for a 21st consecutive NJCAA Div. II, Region IV Championship, allowing another trip to the National Tournament in Clinton, Miss.

The Cavaliers will depend on the strong play and leadership of returning sophomore Mikayla Cole (P/Uti). Cole will provide the knowledge and experience to help guide a young roster. The other sophomore is a solid transfer, Faith Harris (C), who will provide much needed depth and power. This yearâ€™s freshmen are: pitchers Maddie Wallace, Hayley Edmonds, Sydney Reams, and Aubrey Durdan (P/1B); infielders Gabby Schultz (OF), Amber Mussey, Ashley Riner; catchers Sarah Starr, Leann Mossman, Payton Kerness; and outfielders Madalin Evans (OF/MI), Emma Schriner, and Mattie Lanie.

With dependable hitting, power, speed, and young top pitching, the Cavs expect to compete in a tough Region IV with solid opponents Triton, South Suburban, and Prairie State. The schedule also includes match-ups against top ranked Rock Valley, Parkland, Danville, Madison, and Lincoln Land, as well as multiple top D-I schools in Florida. With so many top-level adversaries, the Cavaliers should be well-positioned for a long and successful 2019 season.
