The Cavaliers softball program look to make their mark on the 2019 season with 2 sophomore and 13 freshman players. With a wide variety of pitching, hitting, and defense, they expect to be a strong contender for their 21st consecutive NJCAA D-2 Region Championship, and make another trip to the National Tournament in Clinton, MS.

The Cavaliers will depend on the strong play and leadership of returning sophomore player Mikayla Cole (P/Uti). Cole will be depended on to provide the knowledge and experience to help guide a young roster. The team roster’s a solid sophomore transfer in Faith Harris (C) who will provide much needed depth and power, that compliments freshman pitchers Maddie Wallace, Hayley Edmonds, Sydney Reams, Aubrey Durdan (P/1B), infielders Gabby Schultz (OF), Amber Mussey, Ashley Riner; catchers Sarah Starr, Leann Mossman, Payton Kerness; and outfielders Madalin Evans (OF/MI), Emma Schriner, and Mattie Lanie.

With dependable hitting, power, and speed as well as some young top pitching, the Cav’s expect to compete in a tough Region IV with solid opponents Triton, South Suburban, and Prairie State. The schedule also includes match ups against top ranked Rock Valley, Parkland, Danville, Madison, and Lincoln Land, as well as multiple top D-1 schools in Florida. With so many top level adversaries, the Cavaliers should be well positioned for a long and successful 2019 season.
