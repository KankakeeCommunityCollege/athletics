# Kankakee's Lanie runs to NJCAA Player of the Week honor

The National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) has named Kankakee Community College's Matti Lanie as the [Division II Softball Player of the Week](http://njcaa.org/general/2018-19/POTW_Hub/Player_of_the_Week) for April 1-7 (Week 11). The award is the first for Lanie, and the first this season for the Cavaliers.

Lanie, a freshman outfielder from Momence, Illinois, batted an impressive .739 over seven games, scoring 15 runs and stealing nine bases. The Cavaliers won all seven games to extend a 16-game unbeaten streak, during which Lanie enjoyed her own ten-game hitting streak. In the seven games, she was 17 for 23 and drove in nine runs. In a 13-2 win over the College of DuPage, Lanie was a perfect 4 for 4 with four runs scored and three batted in.

Lanie and the Cavaliers are 19-10-1 on the season and receiving votes in the latest [NJCAA Division II Poll](http://njcaa.org/sports/sball/2018-19/div2/polls).
