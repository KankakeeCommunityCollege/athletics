After trailing 3-1 in the third inning, the KCC Cavaliers used a strong fourth inning to turn the score in their favor, on their way to a 15-5 victory over the Harper College Hawks Tuesday afternoon.

KCC scored once in the first three innings, to make the score 3-1 going into the top of the fourth. Chris Suchowski tripled midway through the fourth, bringing home Amarion Paxton and Nate King to tie the score at three. Dalton Hobick bunted to bring home Suchowski, giving the Cavaliers a 4-3 lead.

KCC held the Hawks to a scoreless fourth inning, before extending their lead to 6-3 in the fifth when Paxton doubled to bring home Curtis McKay and Tyler Thompson. King went out on a sacrifice fly that gave the Cavs another run, and they ended the inning with a four-point lead.

The Cavs added three more runs to their score in the sixth inning to improve their score to 10-3. McKay went out on a sacrifice fly to kick off the inning, and Paxton hit a home run on a fly ball to add two more runs.

The Hawks managed a run in the bottom of the seventh, bringing the score to 10-4.

After both teams were scoreless in the eighth inning, the Cavaliers scored five runs in the ninth, when an error brought Suchowski home and a wild pitch saw Hobick score, too. McKay went out on a sacrifice fly, bringing in a run and putting the Cavaliers ahead 13-4. Thompson singled on a line drive, adding a run and Suchowski walked with bases loaded to push the score to 15-4.

The Hawks scored a run in the bottom of the ninth, but it would be enough to close the Cavs' lead and they secured the ten-point victory.

The Cavaliers improved their record to 24-14-1 and will be on the road again when they play the College of DuPage at 3 pm on Thursday.
