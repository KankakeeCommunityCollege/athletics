Coach Alex Thorson is excited to welcome the first five members of the 2018 recruiting class. These players are Brian Hernandez, Pierce Coleman, Jonte Coleman, Jacob Collins, and Corez Anderson.

When asked what type of players he is trying to bring in he said, “The guys that we are bringing in know how to win, have won, and are going to help us win. But the most important thing is that I want players who not only want to excel on the basketball floor, but in life as well. We are building something special here at KCC, and it is going to start with these student/athletes who excel academically, socially, and athletically.”

Brian Hernandez (Orr High School) is the most recent signee for the Cavaliers. Brian will play the combo guard for the Cavaliers next season after finishing an amazing career at Orr. He helped lead his team to back-to-back state championships in class 2A as well as an overall record of 30-4 for the 2017-2018 season. Hernandez will bring great leadership with his willingness to communicate and push others to be better on a daily basis. The lefty shooter is one of the top shooters in the state of Illinois, and will also be a huge force on the defensive end next season for the Cavs. &nbsp;

Pierce Coleman (North Chicago High School) is another recent signee for the Cavaliers. Pierce will be able to play the one through the three position next season which will make him a force to be reckoned with standing at 6’4”. He helped lead his team this season to a 4th place finish in state for class 3A as well as 22-10 overall record for the 2017-2018 season. Coleman averaged 12.3 PPG, 6 RPG, 6.4 APG, as well as 2 SPG. Pierce will bring a very high basketball IQ with him to Kankakee next season. He has shown a great ability to score the basketball at all three levels as well as do the intangibles of rebounding and making the extra pass.

Jonte Coleman (Champaign Central High School) recently put pen to paper to join the Cavaliers team next season. Jonte is an amazing three point shooter as he will play the shooting guard position for the Cavs next season. Standing at 6’3” he will bring size to that position which will be much needed on both the offensive and defensive ends of the floor. Coleman had a break out senior season for Champaign Central, and helped lead them to an overall record of 20-9. He has shown the ability to shoot the basketball, and towards the later part of his senior season showcased the ability that he is more than just a shooter. The Cavaliers are excited to showcase this ability more in the seasons to come.

Jacob Collins (Indiana Elite Preparatory Academy) was the first player to sign under new Head Coach Alex Thorson for this upcoming 2018 season. Jacob is a 6’2” shooting guard who has continued to progress year after year. Collins has showcased his ability to cause problems for opposing team's players because of his tenacious defense. His length and quickness are his two biggest attributes, and they are going to be on full display next season. Jacob took a prep year after high school and averaged 15 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 5.4 APG, and 3.2 SPG.

Corez Anderson (Urbana High School) recently signed to join the Cavaliers next season. Corez is a 6’0” point guard who has a tremendous ability to score the basketball. He has the ability to hit the three as well as be able to score at the basket in traffic. His length will give a lot of teams trouble as well on the defensive end. The Cavaliers are excited to welcome Corez as a part of the 2018 recruiting class.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Coach Thorson and Coach Neaville are excited to welcome all of the newest signees to the 2018 recruiting class for the Kankakee Community College Men’s Basketball Team. These players are not only going to succeed in basketball, but in every aspect of life as well.
