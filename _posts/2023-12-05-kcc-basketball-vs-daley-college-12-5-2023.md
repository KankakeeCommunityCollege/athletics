The Kankakee Community College Cavaliers took an 84-74 victory over the Richard J Daley College Bulldogs Tuesday night.&nbsp;

Early in the first half, seven points from Joshua Ray helped the Cavaliers spring out to an 11-5 lead. The Bulldogs responded and came within a point, 12-11. KCC later went up 29-17 after a 10-point run. Daley College answered to come within four, at 29-25. Baskets by the Cavs’ Lucas Burton, Chavez Woods and Khylan McKennie were not enough to hold a late surge by the Bulldogs which tied it up 38-38 at the half.

It was back-and-forth through much of the second half.&nbsp; Burton got 5 more points and when Joshua Ray scored on an assist from McKennie, the Cavaliers went up 72-71. They didn’t lose their lead after that. The final run by the Cavs included&nbsp; a three-pointer from Dwain Nash and six more points from Burton.&nbsp;

The Cavaliers improved to 7-4, and they play Malcolm X College at home Thursday at 7:30 p.m. The Lady Cavs take on Morton College at 5:30 p.m. Thursday.

The Thursday basketball doubleheader will be&nbsp; Manteno Night at KCC’s Ryan Gym.&nbsp; All Manteno School District students and teachers are welcome. Elementary students get in free. Junior high, high school students and teachers are free with a student or staff ID. All other adults are $5.
