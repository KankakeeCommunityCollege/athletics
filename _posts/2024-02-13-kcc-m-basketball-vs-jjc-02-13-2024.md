Kankakee Community College established a lead and didn’t let it go in a victory Tuesday on the road in Joliet.

The Cavaliers started with an early 10-2 lead, followed by Noah Mason hitting back-to-back three-pointers. After matching the Joliet Junior College opponents basket-for-basket, Khylan McKennie caught a defensive rebound and scored, kickstarting a KCC scoring surge of nine uninterrupted points to make their lead 38-24. The Wolves scored four points, but KCC responded with nine more before halftime, including a three-pointer from Rashad Smith and four points from Chavez Woods.

The Cavaliers stifled JJC’s attempts to close the gap in the second half. A nine-point run by the Wolves was briefly interrupted by two points from Dwain Nash, but KCC shut it down with three points from Lucas Burton and two more from Woods. Nash scored four points, including a big steal and basket, and McKennie added two more. That made the Cavs’ lead 67-45.

The Cavaliers matched the Wolves for the rest of the half, ultimately taking the win, 81-72.

The Cavaliers improved to 15-10 and will travel to play Daley College Saturday at 1pm.&nbsp;
