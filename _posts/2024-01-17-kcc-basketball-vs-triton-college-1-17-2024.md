Kankakee Community College handed Triton College its first loss of the season in men’s hoops action Wednesday night.&nbsp;

The victory was especially sweet for the Cavaliers to knock off a fellow Region 4 competitor.

Early on, the Cavs and Trojans traded leads. Joshua Ray spurred KCC with an early 3-pointer.

An energetic crowd helped KCC gain momentum and eventually develop a&nbsp; 46-31 lead at halftime.

An offensive effort from the Trojans found early success in the second half and they got within seven points.&nbsp;

After more back-and-forth, KCC got&nbsp; two-points from Dwain Nash, three points from Lucas Burton, and six points from Ray to make the score 93-74.&nbsp; Nash sank two free throws to put the Cavaliers up by 21 points, their biggest lead of the game. As in the first half, the Trojans attempted to make a late comeback, but the Cavaliers’ lead proved to be too great, and they took the victory 101-85.

The Cavs improved to 13-5, extending their winning streak to five games. They will host the Highland Community College Cougars at 3 p.m. Saturday, immediately following the women’s game at 1pm.

Cavaliers stat leaders: Joshua Ray (25 points, 13 rebounds, 2 blocks); Chavez Woods (20 points, 4 rebounds, 6 assists);&nbsp; Lucas Burton (15 points, 4 rebounds);&nbsp; Dwain Nash (13 points, 5 assists); Noah Mason (12 points, 5 rebounds, 2 blocks); Rashad Smith (8 points, 8 rebounds).&nbsp;&nbsp;
