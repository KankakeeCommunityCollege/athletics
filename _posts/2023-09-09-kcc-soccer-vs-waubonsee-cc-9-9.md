Despite a hat-trick by one Cavaliers player, the Kankakee Community College women's soccer team lost to Waubonsee Community College on Saturday, Sept. 9.

KCC’s Cavaliers stayed strong under pressure the entire game. Early in the first half, the Waubonsee Chiefs made several unsuccessful surges toward the net. During one early save, KCC’s goalkeeper Mia Robbins had a cleat strike her face, and she had to leave the field. Freshman goalkeeper Haven Maple filled Robbins’ spot, and racked up multiple saves, while still allowing Waubonsee three goals.

The Cavaliers were able to make several attempts to score as well. &nbsp;The first half ended with the Cavs down 0-3.

Mariel Camargo, a Cavaliers sophomore from Kankakee, brought the Cavaliers hope for a turnaround early in the second, catching a cross-field pass and scoring a quick goal. That was soon followed by a goal from Waubonsee, putting them up 4-1.

Cavs sophomore Samantha Popek made several drives, resulting in shots that missed by a small margin. Camargo scored again, shrinking the Cavs’ deficit to two. The Chiefs returned in full force, but despite their best efforts, Maple continued to save the ball, allowing Waubonsee to score no more goals.

With just ten minutes remaining in the game, Camargo completed the hat trick with her third goal of the game. Despite several attempts, the Cavaliers were unable to get the ball into the net again, and they ended with a tough 3-4 loss.

The Cavaliers fell to 1-3-1 on the season and travel to Madison, Wisconsin, to play Madison College on Tuesday, Sept. 12.
