The Cavaliers are coming off a 42-17 season and a 3rd place finish in the Region IV Tournament.

The 2017 NJCAA DII National Championship was a great accomplishment for the players and the program. We continue to have the same goals for our program, which include preparing our players academically and athletically to be successful at the 4-year university, compete for a Region IV Championship, and win 40 games each season.

The Cavaliers have several key players back for their sophomore seasons. These include OF Dylan Post: .295 BA, 9 2B, 5 3B, 1 HR, 31 RBI, 15 SB, INF Wade Rankin: .455 BA, 11 2B, 1 HR, 20 RBI, and 6 SB, C Jett MCGowan: .308 BA, 7 2B, 24 RBI, DH/1B Cristian Burciaga: .315 BA, 11 2B, 1 HR, 37 RBI, and RHP Will Wentz: 5-0, 1.61 ERA, 28 IP. Nick Barnes: 3-0, 4.03 ERA, 22.1 IP. Sophomore infielders Alex Hoss, Jake Campbell, Tobey Rigsby and transfer Cole Eshleman are looking to contribute this season. On the mound sophomores, LHP Nick Crowe and RHP Donnie Craft are both coming off solid fall outing and look to contribute to the pitching staff.&nbsp;

The freshman will definitely play a key role in the successs of this team. They are led by shortstop Cole Stigleman, who has a dependable glove and a lethal bat. Corner infielders Jaret Humphrey and Michael Machnic will provide some thunder to the middle of the lineup. Nate James also provides a solid middle infielder and a left-handed bat. Outfielders Koltan Moore, Griffin Scaggs and Nate Vargo will also impact the lineup for the Cavaliers. Catcher Nick Anderson provides depth behind the plate or off the bench as a pinch hitter.

On the mound, the team will look to Freshman Nick Laxner, Owen Behrens, Bobby Nowak, Aaron Ball, Jacob Duffy and Tyler Jasmin to solidify the starting rotation. Nolan Lebamoff, Jake Schueter, Tanner Walls, Max Minich and Ike Speiser will compete for innings out of the bullpen.

“We have talent and depth on the pitching staff and will be able to look to multiple players for success this season,” says Head Coach Todd Post. “Pitching and defense is our focus and being consistent in both areas will give us a great chance to win the Region IV Tournament in May.”

The early season for the Cavaliers consists of a 10 game schedule opening up with John A. Logan on the way to Myrtle Beach for the spring trip March 1-9 at the Ripken Experience.
