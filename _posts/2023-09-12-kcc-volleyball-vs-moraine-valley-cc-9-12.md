The Kankakee Community College volleyball team fell to the Moraine Valley Community College in five sets during a difficult match on Tuesday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the first set, former Manteno High School standout Drew Hosselton tipped the ball over the net late, giving the Cavaliers hope, but Moraine Valley responded by scoring two points and claiming the set 27-25. In the second, the Cyclones scored several service aces, creating a small lead which grew until they claimed the set 25-18.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the third, KCC’s Gabrielle Bradley and Valorie Dagg made their marks, recording three kills apiece. Gianna Basile handled the Cavaliers’ defense, scoring on two blocks. Despite a short-lived MVCC run in the middle of the third set, the Cavaliers kept their lead. An error by the Cyclones secured the set for KCC, 25-18.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The comeback continued in the fourth set, with Hosselton adding six kills. The Cavaliers later scored five consecutive points to claim the set 25-23.

The match was tied going into the fifth set. The Cyclones took control of the set early and didn’t budge. Although KCC had a run of four points, two&nbsp; from Bradley, it was not enough. The Cyclones walked out with a 15-12 victory and the match.

The Cavaliers are 4-4 this season and next play Olivet Nazarene University’s junior varsity squad on Friday, Sept. 15 in Bourbonnais, IL.
