The Cavaliers men&apos;s soccer team fell to 0-2 Wednesday following a closely contested 1-0 defeat to Carl Sandburg College.  

KCC&apos;s men&apos;s soccer team faced Carl Sandburg College in their home opener Wednesday.

The first half yielded little in the way of clear-cut goal scoring opportunities for either side. Carl Sandburg held most of the possession, but KCC&apos;s defense stood strong and blocked off any routes to goal.

The Cavaliers came alive in the second half, creating multiple opportunities in front of goal, but they failed to convert any of them.

Despite KCC&apos;s sustained pressure in the opening exchanges of the second half, Carl Sandburg eventually opened the scoring. KCC&apos;s goalkeeper, Carter Levesque, pulled off a couple of great 1v1 saves, but Carl Sandburg&apos;s pressure on the counter attack proved to be the difference between the two teams.

After falling behind, The Cavaliers continued to pile on the pressure, even having one chance cleared off the goal line.

KCC&apos;s efforts proved to be in vain, with the game ending 1-0 in favor of Carl Sandburg College.

In the face of defeat, Levesque remained positive, &ldquo;We put it all together in practice,&rdquo; he said. He later stated that &ldquo;We really just need to come out of the gate firing away. Shoot early, shoot often, and we&apos;ll put a couple in the back of the net,&rdquo; insisting that getting off to a quicker start will be the difference going forward.

Regarding the team&apos;s performance, Levesque said that &ldquo;We adjusted really well,&rdquo; &ldquo;you saw some beautiful one-twos on both sidelines, and you saw a lot of opportunities in the second half,&rdquo; giving insight as to what The Cavaliers can build on going forward.

Levesque added that &ldquo;We just need to adjust earlier and be able to pick up on those things on our own, rather than having to wait for half-time for our coach to tell us,&rdquo; giving the impression that the second half showed opportunities to progress and improve.

The Cavaliers will face off against Rock Valley College at 4 p.m. September 11 away from home in their next match, hoping to turn these building blocks into a win.
