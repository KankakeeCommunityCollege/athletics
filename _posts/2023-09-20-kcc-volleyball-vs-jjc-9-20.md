In spite of big scoring by several team members,&nbsp; the Kankakee Community College volleyball team fell to Joliet Junior College in three sets Wednesday night.&nbsp;

The Cavaliers got off to a strong start in the first set and stayed close until the charging Wolves from JJC, had a six-point surge to end the set 25-15.

The Cavaliers fought back against several big plays for the Wolves in the second, but it was not enough, and JJC won that set 25-20. The Cavaliers were led offensively by Gabrielle Bradley, a Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School graduate, who recorded seven kills.&nbsp;

In the final set, KCC’s Drew Hosselton scored the first point before JJC ran off five straight points. KCC was led in the third set by Valorie Dagg, who scored on two kills and two blocks. Despite Dagg’s success, several runs by the Wolves put them ahead for the set, 25-19, and a match victory.&nbsp;

The Cavaliers (6-5) travel to Waubonsee Community College to play four matches Sept. 22-23 in the “Region 4 Crossover”.&nbsp;
