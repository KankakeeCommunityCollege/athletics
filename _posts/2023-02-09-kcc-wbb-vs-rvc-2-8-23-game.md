  team.
---
The Lady Cavs suffered a 76-67 defeat last night to a hot Rock Valley squad. Despite taking a lead into halftime, the Cavs could not hold on in second half. Jazmyn Smith was the standout player for KCC, finishing with a team-high 23 points on 7-of-14 shooting, along with 8 rebounds, 1 assist, and 3 steals. Na'lani Williams also contributed 13 points and 8 rebounds, while Hayley Diveley had 5 points and 1 assist. This ends KCCâ€™s seven game winning streak, but there are plenty of positives to take away as they prepare to take on a Region IV rival Triton College on Thursday night. Tip off is set for 5:30 pm.
