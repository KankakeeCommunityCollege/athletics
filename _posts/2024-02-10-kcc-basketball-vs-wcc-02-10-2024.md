The Kankakee Community College Lady Cavaliers pushed past several late surges to&nbsp; defeat Waubonsee Community College by seven points on Saturday.

The Cavaliers used early baskets from Valorie Dagg, Jaida Taylor, and Jazmyn Smith to match two three-pointers from the Lady Chiefs. Smith then scored a basket and two free throws to give KCC a 10-6 lead. KCC matched WCC point-for-point until the first quarter ended with a well-timed pass from Harmony Reynolds to Smith, who scored to give the Lady Cavs the lead, 22-18.

Smith scored two points early in the second quarter, quickly followed by a three-pointer from Kayla Jackson and six points from Amaria Pender, including a big steal and basket. Dagg added two points and the Lady Cavaliers were up 35-21 midway through the quarter. The Chiefs scored seven unanswered points, plus a free throw to close the gap. By halftime, KCC’s lead was 39-29.

Six Lady Cavaliers scored in the third quarter, including eight more points for Smith and three-pointers from Myllena de Sousa and Jackson. KCC led 63-44 going into the final quarter.&nbsp;

The Cavaliers worked their way up to a 20-point lead in the fourth quarter following a three-pointer from Pender. WCC scored six straight points before Pender made two free throws. When WCC scored three more points, it was not enough, and KCC took the victory, 74-61.&nbsp;
