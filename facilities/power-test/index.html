                  <h3 class="blue-heading">The Test</h3>
                  <p>The POWER test consists of four basic tests. Each test is a scientifically valid test. It is recommended that five minutes of static stretching, using techniques approved by the Board, be completed prior to each test. A five-minute rest is recommended between each test with a fifteen-minute rest before the 1.5-mile run. The tests will be given in the following sequence with a rest period between each test.</p>
                  <ol>
                      <li><strong>Sit and Reach Test</strong><br />This is a measure of the flexibility of the lower back and upper leg area. It is an important area for performing police tasks involving range of motion and is important in minimizing lower back problems. The test involves stretching out to touch the toes or beyond with extended arms from the sitting position. The score is in the inches reached on a sit and reach box.</li><br />
                      <li><strong>1 Minute Sit-Up Test</strong><br />This is a measure of the muscular endurance of the abdominal muscles. It is an important area for performing police tasks that may involve the use of force and is also an important area for maintaining good posture and minimizing lower back problems. The score is in the number of bent leg sit-ups performed in one minute.</li><br />
                      <li><strong>1 Repetition Maximum Bench Press</strong><br />This is a maximum weight pushed from the bench press position and measures the amount of force the upper body can generate. It is an important area for performing police tasks requiring upper body strength. The score is a ratio of weight pushed divided by body weight.</li><br />
                      <li><strong>1.5 Mile Run</strong><br />This is a timed run to measure the heart and vascular system's capability to transport oxygen. It is an important area for performing police tasks involving stamina and endurance and to minimize the risk of cardiovascular problems. The score is in minutes and seconds.</li><br />
                  </ol>
                  <h3 class="blue-heading">What Are the Standards?</h3>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The actual performance requirement for each test is based upon norms for a national population sample.</li>
                      <li>The applicant must pass every test.</li>
                      <li>The required performance to pass each test is based upon age (decade) and sex. While the absolute performance is different for the eight categories, the relative level of effort is identical for each age and sex group. All recruits are being required to meet the same percentile range in terms of their respective age/sex group. The performance requirement is that level of physical performance that approximates the 40th percentile for each age and sex group.</li>
                  </ul>
