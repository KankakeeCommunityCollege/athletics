Colton Carr strikes out 8 in a perfect game against Queensborough Community College in Myrtle Beach, SC. Carr achieved one of the rarest accomplishments in all of sports - he threw a perfect game. The Cavaliers stuck to old baseball superstition during the final innings of the historic outing. The dugout was nearly silent, and no one said a word to the right-handed hurler. No one wanted to jinx it. For Carr, the potential for perfection sunk in as he was walking off the mound after a 1-2-3 fifth inning. He headed back to the dugout thinking, "Man, I haven't thrown out of the stretch yet," he said. He faced 21 batters and got 21 outs, including a play in the hole by shortstop Alex Mandeville to record the final out in dramatic fashion. Mandeville also provided some big offense for the Cavs, picking up three hits, including a double, with three RBI's and two runs scored.
