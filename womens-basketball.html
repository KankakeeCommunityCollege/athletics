            <p>The Lady Cavaliers have high hopes for the 2022-23 season.</p>
          </div> <div id="collapsePreview" class="collapse"><div class="editable">
  <p>As Casey Meister enters her second season as head coach, she is looking forward to leading a team of players who have all been under her leadership. The team is ready to get back to the winning culture the program is known for.</p>
  <p>This year&rsquo;s team is made up of eight newcomers, all eager to make their mark at KCC. Their success will be defined by how quickly they can adapt and overcome the obstacles of being a new collegiate student athlete. Among the new faces for the Cavaliers are freshmen Anna Hagan, Janila Ellis, Valorie Dagg, Na&rsquo;lani Williams, Kaliyah Wilkins, Jazmyn Smith, Sarah Burton, Myllena DeSousa; and transfer Eva Heinzel. The 22-23 new players have the task of coming in and making a difference on the court right away. They have the ability to play multiple roles on the court, and their versatility will have a big impact.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Amarii Mays, Summer Hill and Hayley Diveley return as the experienced leaders of the group. They know what it takes to grind through a full college season. The team will rely on the returning players for guidance and leadership, but to also put up some stats on the court.&nbsp;<br />This year is full of potential from the coaching staff to the players. The expectations are high. Team goals this season include 20+ wins, becoming Region IV Champions, and competing at the National Tournament.</p>
  <p>These goals will be no easy feat as last season's national runner-up is in our own region. In addition, the Lady Cavaliers have six NJCAA Div. I contests, 21 NJCAA Div. II contests and three NJCAA Div. III contests. This array of competition will test the program and give the team the best chance to be competitive during the postseason.</p>
