            The KCC men's basketball program will look to keep the program's momentum going this season with a new group of players.
            Heading into his 4th year, Head Coach Michael Brown has reloaded with student-athletes from four states to go along with
            four recruits from Illinois.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Every year, we target guys who are the right fit for our program and our institution," Brown said. "It is a good group
            of people that brings versatility, speed, and athleticism. We want to be disciplined, unselfish, and playing together.
            If we can focus on our daily habits and mentality, we should be able to achieve our goal of competing for
            championships."

              Atlanta) also returns after seeing action in 23 games, where he averaged 9 points and 6.5 rebounds. He has the ability
              to make shots with elite athleticism and toughness. Guard Jamonte Smith (6'0", from Roanoke, Virginia) is an extremely
              quick player who will provide leadership and experience. He has elite defensive skills with the ability to make plays
              for himself and others offensively. Guard Quesim Anderson (5'9", from Atlanta) started 21 games last season, averaging

              Martin-Johnson (6'4", from Las Vegas), a redshirt from last season, is a skilled player who gives the team versatility
              with his ability to play inside and outside on the perimeter. Forward Genesis English (6'7" from Chicago), also a
              redshirt from last season, will strengthen the interior with defense and rebounding.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are seven new faces on the Cavs roster. Guard Jeremiah Edwards (6'4" from Stockbridge, Georgia) has natural

              shooting and athleticism to the program. Jaquwan Payton (6'1" from Chicago) is a combo guard who will provide play
              making and scoring.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jervens St. Louis (6'4" from Naples, Florida) is an athletic do-it-all wing. Santana Flowers (6'5" from Sauk Village) is
              an athletic combo forward who competes extremely hard and is always in the right spot. Ricardo Corvil (6'4" from
              Broward, Florida) is a high-level rebounder and capable 3-point shooter. Larry Carthan (6'7" from Chicago) brings
              energy, grit, and toughness to the team.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 2024-25 schedule has the Cavs facing off against tough Region IV opponents as well as matchups with Vincennes
              University, Southeastern Iowa C.C., John A. Logan College, and Indian Hills C.C.
            </p>
