          <p>Last season, the Cavs went into the holiday break with a 5-12 record. They found a bit of a groove in the second half, finishing at 15 wins and 17 losses. In the first round of the conference tournament, the Cavaliers took on Olive Harvey and won. The Cavs then fell to the eventual Region IV champion, Triton College. The lone sophomore last season, Theo Owens, accepted a full scholarship to NAIA Div. II Governors State University. He&rsquo;ll play alongside another former Cavalier, Gerald Duckworth.</p>
          <p>This season, the Cavaliers will feature seven players with previous basketball experience. They will be crucial to helping the freshmen learn what it takes to be successful. As a team the Cavs want to excel on the basketball court, in the classroom and in the community.</p>

        <div id="collapsePreview" class="collapse">
          <div class="editable">
            <p>Returning players</p>
            <p>Jonte Coleman (6&rsquo;4&rdquo;) is a sharp shooter who scored 11 points per game and brought in 5 rebounds per game last year. His leadership along with 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; combo guard Pierce Coleman (8 ppg and 4 rpg) will be crucial for the Cavaliers. Another sophomore returner is Vashawn Sims, one of the most athletic guards in the region. Sims averaged 10 ppg and 4 assists per game last season. A great counterpart to Sims&rsquo; great passing is knock down shooter Oren Amotz, who will be one of the best shooters Region 4 has seen in a long time. Brian Hernandez is also returning, and will be a medical redshirt. Hernandez will bring leadership with his great communication skills.</p>
            <p>Transfers</p>
            <p>Coach Thorson also hit the transfer portal to bring in additional experience. Bjorn Knutson, comes from NCAA Div. II Bemidji State, where he was a redshirt freshman last year. Knutson brings great depth to the wing with ability to finish strong or knock down the open three. Qwentin Peacock has shown the ability to be one of the best shooters on the team. Peacock transferred from Ancilla College, and has a great basketball IQ.</p>
            <p>Freshmen</p>
            <p>Zion Washington comes from North Lawndale with unbelievable athleticism and a 6&rsquo;9&rdquo; frame for prolific shot blocking. Damari Nixon had a great prep career at Curie H.S. in Chicago. With abilities ranging from lock-down defender to knock-down shooter, we are excited for him to transition to point guard.</p>
            <p>Along with those two Chicago talents, the Cavs brought in top talent from Kankakee and nearby Cissna Park. Christian Stadeli (6&rsquo;7&rdquo;) was a first team all-state player who can score in the post and rebound. Julian Stadeli (6&rsquo;7&rdquo;), Christian&rsquo;s twin, is a great defender. He&rsquo;s what coaches love to call a &ldquo;junk yard dog.&rdquo; Julian and Christian were coached by one of the best in the area, Kevin Long, and Cissna Park finished 2nd in IHSA class 1A last season. Another top local talent the Cavaliers targeted early was point guard Andre Robertson (5&rsquo;8&rdquo;), who will be one of the best defenders on the team. After playing for Coach Chris Pickett at Kankakee H.S., the Cavaliers knew Robertson would be mentally and physically prepared for the college game.</p>
            <p>Three other new players come from outside the United States. Michael Moshkovitz and Bar Shefa both come from Jerusalem, Israel, and are poised to bring great knowledge and ability to the Cavaliers. Moshkovitz (6&rdquo;7&rdquo;), is an outstanding passer who plays at all three levels of the court. Bar Shefa (6&rsquo;4&rdquo;) is a point guard with the basketball IQ and toughness to play four positions. He will be hard to stop. Ahmed Mahmoud (6&rsquo;6&rdquo;) attended high school in the U.S., but is originally from Egypt. He can shoot, dribble, pass, and score in the post.</p>
            <p>The coaching staff and players are excited to embark on the 2019-20 season. The focus continues to improve the culture of KCC men&rsquo;s basketball. Please join us for as many home games as possible. We truly believe you will not be disappointed!</p>
