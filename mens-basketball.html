          <p>The KCC men&rsquo;s basketball program will look to keep last year&rsquo;s momentum going. Second year Head Coach Michael Brown has brought in student-athletes from seven states, plus an international recruit.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Every year we target guys that are the right fit for our program and our institution,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;It is a fun group that brings versatility, toughness, and the type of mentality we need to be successful. We want to be disciplined, unselfish and playing together. We want to get back to the region championship game.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>This year&rsquo;s team will feature five freshmen and seven sophomores. Four players are returning from last year&rsquo;s NJCAA All-Academic Team which also placed as the Div. I Region IV Runner-up team.</p>
            <p>On the wing, Isaiah Placide (6&rdquo; 5&rdquo;; Atlanta, Georgia) is an all-around player who averaged 12 points and 5.7 rebounds last season while shooting 39% on 3-pointers. Josh Holmes (6&rsquo;3&rdquo;, Chicago) averaged 6 points and 3 rebounds last season while shooting 3 pointers at a 39% clip. He is a versatile guard who will be counted on for his shooting, defense, and toughness. Robert Stroud (6&rsquo;6&rdquo;, Danville) is an athletic do-it-all forward who will help the Cavs again this season. Last season, Stroud averaged 8 points and 4 rebounds per game. Kason Williams (6&rsquo;0&rdquo;; Montgomery, Alabama) is a guard who improved in the off-season and will look to increase his role. Williams is a smart player with natural ability to make plays for himself and others.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There are eight new faces to the Cavs roster. Sean Black (Indianapolis) is a quick and athletic guard who transferred from Iowa Western College, where he averaged 10 points and 3 assists per game last season. Noah Mason (6&rsquo;7&rdquo;; Humble, Texas) is a skilled forward who brings versatility with his ability to play inside and outside on the perimeter. Wing Amari Jones (6&rsquo;6&rdquo;; Asbury Park, N.J.) is a smooth multi-position player who can affect the game in a variety of ways. Guard Cha&rsquo;vez Woods (6&rsquo;2&rdquo;, Louisville) brings outside shooting, athleticism, and toughness to the program.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Rashad Smith (6&rsquo;7&rdquo;, Atlanta) is an athletic combo forward who can dribble, pass and shoot. Jaelyn Anderson (6&rsquo;2&rdquo;, Atlanta) is a combo guard who provides play making, scoring and defense. Jamonte Smith (6&rsquo;0&rdquo;; Roanoke, Virginia) is an extremely quick player who provides the team with another option at guard. His abilities include defense and making plays for himself and others.&nbsp; Guard Antonin Tukilonga (6&rsquo;4&rdquo;, Canada) is a strong and athletic player who provides the Cavs with depth and outside shooting.</p>
            <p>The 2022-23 schedule has the Cavs facing off against tough Region IV opponents as well as road matchups with Vincennes University, Mineral Area College, and Indian Hills C.C.</p>
            <p>The coaching staff and players are excited about the upcoming season and hope that fans will come out and support the team.</p>
